### Classes and Objects review

**What is a class?**

A class describes an object in terms of its
  - data (variables/fields)
  - operations (functions/methods)

Any concept you wish to implement in a Java program must be _encapsulated_ within a class!

A student class example

```java
class Student {
	int rollNumber;
	String name;
	double marks;
	
	// ...
}
```
